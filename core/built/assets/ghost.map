major difference:\n   *\n   * Instead of passing a \"submitting\" parameter (which is bound to the parent object),\n   * you pass an ember-concurrency task. All of the \"submitting\" behavior is handled automatically.\n   *\n   * As another bonus, there's no need to handle canceling the promises when something\n   * like a controller changes. Because the only task running is handled through this\n   * component, all running promises will automatically be cancelled when this\n   * component is removed from the DOM\n   */\n  const GhTaskButton = Ember.Component.extend({\n    tagName: 'button',\n    classNameBindings: ['isRunning:appear-disabled', 'isIdleClass', 'isRunningClass', 'isSuccessClass', 'isFailureClass'],\n    attributeBindings: ['disabled', 'form', 'type', 'tabindex'],\n    task: null,\n    taskParams: null,\n    disabled: false,\n    defaultClick: false,\n    buttonText: 'Save',\n    idleClass: '',\n    runningClass: '',\n    showSuccess: true,\n    // set to false if you want the spinner to show until a transition occurs\n    successText: 'Saved',\n    successClass: 'gh-btn-green',\n    failureText: 'Retry',\n    failureClass: 'gh-btn-red',\n    // Allowed actions\n    action: () => {},\n    runningText: Ember.computed.reads('buttonText'),\n    // hasRun is needed so that a newly rendered button does not show the last\n    // state of the associated task\n    hasRun: Ember.computed('task.performCount', function () {\n      return this.get('task.performCount') > this._initialPerformCount;\n    }),\n    isIdleClass: Ember.computed('isIdle', function () {\n      return this.isIdle ? this.idleClass : '';\n    }),\n    isRunning: Ember.computed('task.last.isRunning', 'hasRun', 'showSuccess', function () {\n      let isRunning = this.get('task.last.isRunning');\n\n      if (this.hasRun && this.get('task.last.value') && !this.showSuccess) {\n        isRunning = true;\n      }\n\n      return isRunning;\n    }),\n    isRunningClass: Ember.computed('isRunning', function () {\n      return this.isRunning ? this.runningClass || this.idleClass : '';\n    }),\n    isSuccess: Ember.computed('hasRun', 'isRunning', 'task.last.value', function () {\n      if (!this.hasRun || this.isRunning || !this.showSuccess) {\n        return false;\n      }\n\n      let value = this.get('task.last.value');\n      return !Ember.isBlank(value) && value !== false;\n    }),\n    isSuccessClass: Ember.computed('isSuccess', function () {\n      return this.isSuccess ? this.successClass : '';\n    }),\n    isFailure: Ember.computed('hasRun', 'isRunning', 'isSuccess', 'task.last.error', function () {\n      if (!this.hasRun || this.isRunning || this.isSuccess) {\n        return false;\n      }\n\n      return this.get('task.last.error') !== undefined;\n    }),\n    isFailureClass: Ember.computed('isFailure', function () {\n      return this.isFailure ? this.failureClass : '';\n    }),\n    isIdle: Ember.computed('isRunning', 'isSuccess', 'isFailure', function () {\n      return !this.isRunning && !this.isSuccess && !this.isFailure;\n    }),\n\n    init() {\n      this._super(...arguments);\n\n      this._initialPerformCount = this.get('task.performCount');\n    },\n\n    click() {\n      // let the default click bubble if defaultClick===true - useful when\n      // you want to handle a form submit action rather than triggering a\n      // task directly\n      if (this.defaultClick) {\n        if (!this.isRunning) {\n          this._restartAnimation.perform();\n        }\n\n        return;\n      } // do nothing if disabled externally\n\n\n      if (this.disabled) {\n        return false;\n      }\n\n      let task = this.task;\n      let taskName = this.get('task.name');\n      let lastTaskName = this.get('task.last.task.name');
